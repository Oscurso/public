✅  CYBERSECURITY DEMO COMPLETE

KEY FINDINGS:
  🎯 Threat Intelligence:
     • Ransomware delivered via phishing (0.89 strength)
     • APT groups exploit zero-days (0.91 strength)
     • Lateral movement enables privilege escalation (0.88)
     • Data exfiltration follows privilege escalation (0.84)

  🛡️  Defense Insights:
     • EDR detects ransomware and prevents lateral movement
     • SIEM aggregates EDR telemetry (0.93 strength)
     • Threat hunting uses SIEM intelligence (0.89)
     • Security automation accelerates incident response (0.91)

VALUE PROPOSITION:
  ODI processes 9 months of threat data, uncovering attack
  patterns and defensive gaps that manual analysis would miss.
  Automated consolidation enables proactive threat hunting
  and optimized security operations.
