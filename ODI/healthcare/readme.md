✅  HEALTHCARE DEMO COMPLETE

KEY FINDINGS:

  🎯 Clinical Impact:
     • Discovered comorbidity patterns (Type 2 Diabetes + Hypertension)
     • Identified kidney monitoring requirements for multiple medications
     • Found lifestyle intervention opportunities (diet + exercise)
     • Revealed care coordination needs across specialties

  📈 System Benefits:
     • Improved patient safety through drug interaction detection
     • Enhanced care quality via multidisciplinary team insights
     • Reduced readmissions through adherence monitoring
     • Optimized resource allocation using pattern analysis

VALUE PROPOSITION:
  ODI processes months of patient data overnight, discovering
  treatment patterns and safety insights that would take clinical
  teams weeks to identify manually. Real-time consolidation
  enables proactive, evidence-based care decisions.
