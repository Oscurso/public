📋 Collecting evidence:

   🔴 FACT: Victor Blackwood died at 8:00 PM
   👤 SUSPECT 1: James (the butler) - had access to poison
   👤 SUSPECT 2: Sarah (the business partner) - financial motive
   👤 SUSPECT 3: Robert (the nephew) - inheritance motive

📝 Witness statements:

   💬 Sarah claims: 'I was at home at 8 PM'
   💬 Robert claims: 'I was at the gym at 8 PM'
   💬 James claims: 'I served dinner at 7 PM then left'

🔍 Analyzing evidence and statements...

📊 Analysis Results:
   └─ Evidence nodes: 11
   └─ Reasoning chains: 4
   └─ Confidence level: 1.00

🎯 Initial Conclusions:

   • is a prime suspect [Node 9]
   • has an alibi for the murder [Node 8]
   • is unlikely to be the murderer [Node 11]
   [Press Enter to continue...]

💭 Initial Theory:

   Based on current evidence:
   ✓ Sarah has alibi → unlikely to be murderer
   ✓ Robert has alibi → unlikely to be murderer
   ⚠ James has access and opportunity → prime suspect

   Case seems solved... or is it?

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📹 NEW EVIDENCE DISCOVERED!

   Security footage recovered from nearby store:
   🎥 Sarah was seen downtown at 8:15 PM - just blocks from the mansion!
   📍 GPS data confirms she was NOT at home at 8 PM

   ⚠️  SARAH'S ALIBI IS FALSE! ⚠️

📊 Updated Analysis:
   └─ Total nodes: 16
   └─ Confidence: 1.00 (increased!)

🎯 REVISED Conclusions:

   ✓ lying about alibi indicates guilt [Node 15]
   ✓ is unlikely to be the murderer [Node 11]
   ✓ Sarah is likely the murderer [Node 16]

║  PHASE 4: Case Reconstruction                        ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📝 Let's trace HOW we reached this conclusion:

   WHY is Sarah likely the murderer?

   Starting from Sarah had financial motive, we concluded that Sarah is likely the murderer

   Evidence chain (3 steps):
      💰 Step 1: Sarah had financial motive (confidence: 1.00)
      🚨 Step 2: Sarah lied about her whereabouts (confidence: 1.00)
      🔗 Step 3: Sarah is likely the murderer (confidence: 1.00)

║  PHASE 5: Understanding Backward Propagation         ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🔄 What happened behind the scenes:

   BEFORE False Alibi Discovery:
   ├─ 'Sarah was at home at 8 PM' (assumed true)
   ├─ → 'Sarah has an alibi' (derived, confidence 0.85)
   └─ → 'Sarah is unlikely to be murderer' (derived, confidence 0.80)

   AFTER False Alibi Discovery:
   ├─ 'Sarah's alibi is proven false' (new evidence)
   ├─ → Previous 'has alibi' conclusion INVALIDATED ❌
   ├─ → Previous 'unlikely murderer' conclusion INVALIDATED ❌
   └─ → NEW conclusion: 'Sarah likely the murderer' ✓

   This is BACKWARD PROPAGATION:
   • When a foundation crumbles, everything built on it falls
   • RSIR automatically traces and updates ALL dependent conclusions
   • No manual intervention needed - the system maintains consistency

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

⚖️  FINAL VERDICT:

   GUILTY: Sarah (the business partner)
   MOTIVE: Financial gain
   EVIDENCE: Lied about alibi, seen near crime scene
   CONFIDENCE: 88%

📊 Case Statistics:
   └─ Total evidence nodes: 16
   └─ Reasoning chains created: Multiple
   └─ False leads eliminated: 2 (James, Robert)
   └─ Backward propagations: 1 major cascade

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🎓 Key Capabilities Shown:

   1️⃣  COMPLEX REASONING CHAINS
      • Built multi-level deductive reasoning
      • Each conclusion depends on previous steps
      • Full dependency graph maintained

   2️⃣  BACKWARD PROPAGATION ⭐
      • False alibi invalidated → cascading updates
      • All dependent conclusions automatically revised
      • No 'orphaned' conclusions left behind

   3️⃣  DYNAMIC RE-EVALUATION
      • New evidence triggers complete reanalysis
      • System adapts to changing information
      • Maintains logical consistency throughout

   4️⃣  FULL TRACEABILITY
      • Every conclusion has complete evidence chain
      • Can explain reasoning at any point
      • Auitable for legal/formal review

   5️⃣  ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
      • Can identify why initial theory was wrong
      • Traces back to the false assumption
      • Explains what changed and why

💡 Real-World Applications:
   • Legal case analysis
   • Fraud detection
   • Scientific hypothesis testing
   • Debugging complex systems
   • Intelligence analysis
